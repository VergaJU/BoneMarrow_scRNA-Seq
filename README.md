# BoneMarrow_scRNA-Seq

Collection of scripts, pipelines and files used to create a new dataset of scRNA-Seq data for my project:

The project is focused on the creation of a new collection of scRNA-Seq studies of Bone marrow samples from Multiple myeloma patients.

To made the studies comparable I decided to pre-process all the files from raw files (fastq/bam/sra), from the alignment to the batch-correction and cell type identification.

The repo is organised in:
- [Pre processing](./Pre-process)
- [Quality control](./Quality-control)
- [Merging/Batch correction](./Merge_batch-correct)
- [Cell type annotation](./Cell_type-Annotation/)
